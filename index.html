		<p><div style ="color:rgb(79, 216, 120)"> Nazaré (Portuguese for Nazareth) is arguably Portugal’s most picturesque fishing village,</div> although its days as a traditional place are long gone.<br>
		<hr>
		It has become internationally famous for having the world’s biggest waves, and as a result it is now better known as a surfing mecca.</p>
		<p class="blue"><span style ="color:#006400;">Located in the center of the country, less than 90 minutes north of Lisbon, it hasn’t lost its laid-back ambience</span>, but local traditions are only preserved for visitors to get a taste of the old days.<br>
		Fish is still put out to dry in the sun, colorful fishing boats remain on the beach, and some older locals hold on to the traditional dress -- berets for men, and shawls and seven skirts or petticoats for women.
